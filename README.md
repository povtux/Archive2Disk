MS Outlook VSTO plugin to enable to extract large amount of individual mail files to disk

to install the last build, you can download the setup from: http://apps.verschoore.fr
before running the setup, you must add "http://apps.verschoore.fr" in your trusted sites in your internet options. If you don't do that, you will be able to launch the setup and then, you will have an error because of the untrusted place to get needed files.
